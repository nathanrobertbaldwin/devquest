WELCOME TO DEVQUEST

DevQuest is a game app built using Flask, React, and Redux as a game engine. In DevQuest, you create a fledgeling software engineer character. Over the course of the game, you will fight turn-based battles against monsters (programming bugs), collect equipment (programming necessities like coffee), and gain permanent bonuses to your character like stat boosts to you "debugging" ability. Your goal is to survive all ten encounters, including the final "Capstone Project" monster, in order to graduate and become a Fullstack Engineer!
