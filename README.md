============ WELCOME TO DEVQUEST ============

DevQuest is a game about being a full-stack software developer. The game takes place over five levels. At each level, the player encounters a new monster. Each monster is a common issue faced by software devs, such as a the "Stack Overflow" monster, or the dreaded "Style A Page" monster. The player will defeat monsters with moves such as "console.log" or "pair program." Complete all five levels within the time limit -- including the final Capstone Project -- in order to graduate and become a full-stack engineer!
